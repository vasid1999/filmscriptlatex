\scene{EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE - NIGHT}

\action{Somewhere out in the European mountains, \charname{Thor} throws \charname{Loki} into the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJÖLNIR. He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is angry to see him alive in this fashion.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{Where is the Tesseract?}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\parenthetical{laughs}
\dialogue{I missed you too.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.}

\action{\charname{Thor} drops MJÖLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up \charname{Loki}. His brother. Although \charname{Thor} is pissed for what he has done, a family is everything to a man or god.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{I thought you dead.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{Did you mourn?}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{We all did. Our father...}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not?}

\action{\charname{Thor} lets go \charname{Loki}, who walks away from \charname{Thor}, causing an even bigger wedge between them.} 

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\parenthetical{turns around}
\dialogue{I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\parenthetical{laughs}
\dialogue{And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I mean to rule them. And why should I not?}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{You think yourself above them.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{Well, yes.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.}

\action{Angrily, \charname{Loki} shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up to the ledge. Turns around.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{I am a king!}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off I know not where.}

\action{Mjölnir flies back to his grasp.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Thor}}
\dialogue{You listen well, brother. I...}

\action{\charname{Thor} IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY \charname{Iron Man} WHO TACKLES HIM IN MID-FLIGHT.}

\dialoguetitle{\charname{Loki}}
\dialogue{I'm listening.}
